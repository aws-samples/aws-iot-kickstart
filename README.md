The **IoT Pilot Kickstart solution** has been designed to simplify getting started on AWS IoT, by providing you with a boilerplate, sample application to onboard and manage IoT devices with minimalistic realtime data visualization capabilities.

Project named _Sputnik_, after (one of?) the first satellites.

Sputnik's goal is to help you get started and connecting your IoT devices to AWS and start generating business value from your use-case.

As part of this first release, Sputnik can, in theory, support all types of devices, however as part of this first release, for now, we have only included blueprints for the Raspberry Pi, Intel Up2, Deeplens and a dummy ESP32 device.
We will be including more device blueprints as we go along, and hope the community and the AWS partner eco-system will participate in the creation of these blueprints.

Also, as part of this first release, Sputnik only supports deployment to Greengrass based devices. Amazon FreeRTOS support currently is work in progress.
